This project is an interactive application designed to help travelers communicate in foreign countries by generating useful phrases in the local language. Built with Gradio, it provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input tasks either by typing or recording their voice.

## Features

- **Input Methods**: Users can either type a task (e.g., "order food") or record their voice.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language spoken in a selected country.
- **Phrase Generation**: Generates a list of commonly used phrases for the selected task and country.
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts recorded audio to text using the Whisper model.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Gradio for an intuitive and responsive user experience.

```bash
pip install gradio langchain_community whisper openai torch
```

## How to Use
